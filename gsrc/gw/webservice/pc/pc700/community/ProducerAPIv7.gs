/**
 * Provides web service API methods for managing producer codes, agencies,
 * and branches. Agencies are a type of Organization. Branches are
 * a type of Group. Branch objects are distinguished from regular Group objects
 * by having a non-<code>null</code> value for the "BranchCode" attribute.<p>
 *
 * Each Organization in turn may have an associated tree of Group entities.
 * For a Group, the term "ancestors" means the group's ancestors in its
 * Group tree.<p>
 *
 * <em>IMPORTANT Groups and producer codes can be arranged hierarchically, but
 * organizations (including agencies) are not arranged hierarchically.
 *
 * Every ProducerCode is associated with a single Branch, and there
 * is a many-to-many correspondence between ProducerCodes and agencies (and
 * their associated Groups).<p>
 *
 * The <em>Agency-ProducerCode</em> constraint limits the associations
 * between Agencies and ProducerCodes. If particular,
 * if <em>D</em> is any descendant of an agency <em>A</em>, then the
 * ProducerCodes associated with <em>D</em> must be a (not necessarily
 * proper) subset of the ProducerCodes associated with <em>A</em>. The
 * methods of this interface are guaranteed to maintain this constraint.
 * For example, when the association between a ProducerCode and an agency
 * <em>A</em> is removed, this interface takes care of removing the the
 * association between that ProducerCode and all of <em>A</em>'s descendants.<p>
