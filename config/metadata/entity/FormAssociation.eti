    An entity that can be used to associate a Form to an entity in the policy graph.  The foreign keys on this entity
      should generally only be used for matching purposes to determine if two versions of a Form that have the same
      pattern are associated with the same object, and the fks should never be traversed due to the ambiguity of
      when that traversal will take place in model or effective time.  This entity can either be extended or subclassed
      in order to add in additional foreign keys; the out of the box product chooses the subclassing strategy to allow
      subclasses and their foreign keys to be packaged in LOB-specific files that also contain the entities being
      pointed to.
