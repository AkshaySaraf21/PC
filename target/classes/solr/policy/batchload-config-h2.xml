    param is taken from the Guidewire app, not from the parameter below and the

    that file, not from the parameter below.

    <!--
    The parameter absolutePathToSortExe specifies what sort facility the
    SolrBatchLoader should use. You can either specify the literal "internalSort"
    or an absolute path to an external sort utility:

    1.) internalSort : this will cause the SolrBatchLoader to use an in-memory
    Java-based sort facility. This option should be used only in development/demo
    mode where the number of entity rows to be fetched by the batch loader is less
    than 10000 (if you exceed 10000 rows, the batch loader will throw an exception).

    2.) <abolute_path_to_an_external_sort_utility> : this will cause the
    SolrBatchLoader to use an external, high-performance sort utility. This option
    should be used in production mode. On Unix/Linux the sort utility is typically
    located at /usr/bin/sort. On Windows, Guidewire only supports the Cygwin sort
    utility (you must download and install Cygwin). Typically, the Cygwin sort
    utility is located at c:\cygwin\bin\sort.exe. Be sure to include the .exe
    extension in the value of absolutePathToSortExe if you are specifying the
    location of the sort utility on Windows.
    -->
    <param name="absolutePathToSortExe" value="internalSort"/>
    <param name="sortType" value="lexicographic"/>

    <!--
    The three parameters, sortFieldArgStyle, entitySortMemSize, and absolutePathToSortTmpDir, are enabled
    only if you are using an external sort utility. The parameters entitySortMemSize and absolutePathToSortTmpDir
    are also only enabled for the entity. That is, the sorts for mvFields just get the default values, which should
    be adequate for their smaller sizes.

    <!--
    The list of transforms (as defined in the <transformer> elements; see below)
    gets applied to the stream of documents coming out of the last joiner. The
    application of these transforms to any one document is independent of their application
    to all other documents. So, the stream of documents can be partitioned and the list of
    transforms can be applied in parallel to each partition. The following parameter
    specifies how many partitions and separate threads should be created to do the
    transforming. In order to run multiple transformer threads, ALL TRANSFORMER CLASSES
    MUST BE THREAD SAFE. In particular, since the input line and the transformed
    output line are in XML and XML parsing and formatting are not thread safe, you must
    allocate separate parsers and formatters for each instance of a transformer. In other
    words, your transformer should not share static resources unless you are sure they
    are read-only/immutable. Serializing access to shared static resources will just degrade
    performance. The maximum number of transform threads is 10.
